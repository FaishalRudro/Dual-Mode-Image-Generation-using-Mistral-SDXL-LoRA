# Dual-Mode-Image-Generation-using-Mistral-SDXL-LoRA
Dual-mode AI image generator: user prompts refined via Mistral-7B, then SDXL with LoRA produces high-quality images in anime, painting, portrait, landscape, wikiart, and sketch styles. Supports text→image &amp; image→image with ControlNet + IP-Adapter, using mixed multi-dataset training and PIL-only transforms. 
To use the model you can visit (https://huggingface.co/spaces/RudroBoss/Multi_Style_Image_Generator), but as this is a free deployment platform, so we had to make some changes such as removing controlNet and Mistral.
